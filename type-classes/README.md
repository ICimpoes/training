# Type classes and implicits

Type classes
have been shown to provide a type-safe solution to important
challenges in software engineering and programming
languages such as, for example, retroactive extension of
programs.
Typeclass design pattern in Scala is a very powerful type-safe solution to important challenges in software engineering as decoupling and retroactive extension.
Originally implemented as a Haskell language feature, the typeclass pattern in Scala leverages implicits to achieve additional flexibility and control.
